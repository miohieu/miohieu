## Vu Minh Hieu

Hi there! My name is Vu Minh Hieu, after being self-taught I'm currently enrolled in a frontend bootcamp where I'm learning the latest technologies and best practices in frontend development. My goal is to become a master of JavaScript and other frontend skills, so that I can build amazing web applications that users will love.

**What I'm Learning**

So far in the bootcamp, I've learned:

  HTML and CSS fundamentals, how to use libraries. 

  Responsive design with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap

  JavaScript basics, including variables, functions, and control flow

  Object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript

  Frontend frameworks like React

I'm also working on improving my skills in:

  *Reactjs


*nodejs

*Version control with Git

*Package management with npm

**Favorite Reading**

As a developer, I love to read books about coding and software development. Two of my favorite books are "Head First JavaScript" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson, and "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.

"Head First JavaScript" is a great resource for anyone who is just starting out with JavaScript, as it provides a fun and interactive way to learn the language. It covers everything from basic syntax and data types to advanced topics like asynchronous programming and debugging.

"Clean Code" is a must-read for any developer who wants to write high-quality, maintainable code. It provides practical advice and best practices for writing code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

I highly recommend both of these books to anyone who is serious about improving their coding skills and becoming a better developer.

**Favorite Quote**
As someone who is passionate about coding, I live by the motto "Learning to code is not learning syntax, but learning how to build things." This quote reminds me that coding is not just about memorizing syntax and language features, but about using those tools to create something useful and meaningful. Whether it's a website, a mobile app, or a game, the end result is what matters most.
